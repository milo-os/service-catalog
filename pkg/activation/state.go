package activation

// State is the CLI-facing activation state derived from a project's
// ServiceEntitlement (or its absence). It is a pure reduction of phase, the
// Ready condition, and timestamps — never of the root Service's enablement
// policy — so the first status write answers the regime authoritatively.
